# Diabetes
Initial Requirements: To create an app that dynamically calculates insulin sensitivity and other key metrics.

#ToDo
- Write unit tests that deserialize json objects that are invalid due to attributes and check this works (though this should be sorted by unit tests for attributes themselves).
- Complete unit tests for UserConfig handler, starting with LoadOrCreate.
- Once UserConfigHandler unit tests are complete, go back to RecalculateLongActingOnly
